# responsive-site

Just a simple fully responsive website with minimal functionality that i did way back when i started learning front end. This website's main purpose was to practice my understanding of responsive web apps and to practice some javascript dom manipulation more than a year ago.

The template and design were taken from https://www.w3schools.com/ and this was just my attempt of recreating it in order to test my knowledge at that time. And in no way does this represent my current knowledge of front end development. :D

Occasionally i may add some new features
    -added shopcart logic just to brush up on some js DOM manipulation skills.
