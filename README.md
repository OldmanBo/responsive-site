# responsive-site

Just a simple fully responsive site with minimal functionality that i did way back when i started learning front end. The template and design were taken from https://www.w3schools.com/. This site's main purpose was to pracitce my understanding of responsive web apps and to practice some dom manipulation a year ago.
